# ELO-System

This c# script was created in August 2018 and uploaded to github on 25th march 2019

This is a console script that manages a ELO system (the score system used in Chess and League of Legends)
It prints on the console all the results. If you need to implement that in a user interface and make it beautiful/user-friendly, just contact me, I can do that easily.
