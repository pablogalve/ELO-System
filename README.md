# ELO-System

This is a console script that manages a ELO system (the score system used in Chess and other games such as League of Legends or Clash of Clans)
It prints the results on the console. 
If you need to implement that in a user interface and make it beautiful/user-friendly, just contact me, I could help you with that.
